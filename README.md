Final Assignment for Real World Interactions in C#

Proposal:
this project is to develop a weather forecast application using the C# programming language, the relevant concepts learned from classes and the Avalonia framework. 
The application will provide users with the ability to access and display weather data for selected cities.

To colab on github follow: https://medium.com/@jonathanmines/the-ultimate-github-collaboration-guide-df816e98fb67 from step 3
For each function that you implement (Ie GUI for example) Make a branch and then once we determine it is working we can merge to master
Avoids having issue where after implementing multiple stuff breaks the code since we can revert it and know which specific one killed it

Task list / Proposed mode of operation
1. Feature list
	* Live tracking?
	* Interval changeable?
	* Length to view?
	* Making a graph?
	* --> Most likely since we are on time crunch we just make a list which shows the current selected stocks prices (No historical data) with refresh button
	* News?
	* Show price for specific time in history?
2. Nail down HL architecture
	* Basically make high level UML Diagram
	* Make check list of each feature
3. Split work
	* I'll take over networking and GUI (Might change from Avalonia to WPF though)
4. Timeline (self established)
	* Just so we know where we roughly shold be but this is for your self as long as within deadline
5. After each function test and if everything works with no/few bugs merge into Main branch
6. Make documentation (README and update any order docs (Like UML))




## Planning
### Project Planning

### Application Idea and relevant services

### UML Class Diagrams

### Networking Component

### Data Storage and Computation

### Parallelization

### GUI Design

### Testing and Debugging (ALSO TO BE APPLIED ON EACH COMPONENT, like the v model)

### Documentation
